About:

We are the best IDE with curated inventory of the best AI tools on the market (ie. Perplexity, aider, mem0, etc.), to make it easy for you to make what you want. Imagine if VSCode was reimagined with AI in mind since the beginning.

FAQ:

Why PearAI over competitors?
Over using vanilla LLMâs: 
Codebase Knowledge: PearAI has knowledge, or context, of your codebase achieved through RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and other integrated features that will make your AI coding experience seamless.
Over other extensions: 
No AI model vendor lock-in for higher quality code generation. We guarantee you we use the best model for your use case based on the most up-to-date leaderboards.
User Experience: As a complete IDE rather than just an extension, PearAI provides a more integrated and refined coding environment. This allows for smoother workflows and more intuitive interactions when coding with AI.
Over other AI Code Editors: 
Different: Competitors are approaching the huge task of coding with AI in a one-size-fits-all manner. Building for the future, PearAI has PearAI Inventory, which integrates the best tools for each part of the AI tech stack (chat assistant, code generation, search, collaboration, memory, etc.) into a unified, seamless user experience. Leading tools for each part changes rapidly, but individually beat each part of the monolith approach to coding with AI. With PearAI, we ensure you have the best-on-market experience of coding with AI at any given time. 
Last but not least: We are fully transparent and Open Source. Anyone can see, review, and contribute to our code! This allows for a community-driven product, mitigates privacy concerns that other similar tools face, and provides a faster development cycle thanks to our community. We want PearAI to be a culture. Read more: Why Open Source Matters for AI Code Editors.

Why PearAI?

You just want to be able to make what you want, fast. PearAI gets you that.
The AI tooling space is moving too quickly for most to keep up with. One day product X is best for code generation, the next day itâs product Y. PearAI aims to natively integrate the best-in-market AI tools for each aspect of coding with AI (tooling for code generation, LLM, search, codebase knowledge, debugging, etc.), so you can just focus on building as efficiently as possible.

How it works -
We build banks and credit card issuers browser extensions to help them capture a larger share of wallet among their cardholders by -

ð Migrating Existing Spend

- When a credit card program onboards a new user, we make it dead simple for these users to switch their card-on-file at all of their top online merchants to their new card with one click.
- Our AI-powered browser extension not only automatically detects where our partners' users spend the most (Netflix, Amazon, T-mobile, Progressive), but also lets them switch out their primary payment instantly. Users press a button in their browser and their card-on-file everywhere instantly switches to their shiny new card (our partner's card!).

ð Making Checkout Seamless

- Our fast checkout technology embeds âOne Tap Checkout â on the checkout page at over 50,000 e-commerce sites - making our partners' cards the easiest way for users to complete any transaction on their browser. 
- They can even customize the copy to tell the user why to use your card for that specific purchase. For example Chase could prompt their users to use their Sapphire Preferred card on Avis BECAUSE it offers car rental insurance.

ð¤ Making Our Partners' Cards More Rewarding
- We partner with over 1000 of the countryâs top merchants to offer additional affiliate-based cash back that our partners can tack on to their existing cash back. User can now earn double or even triple the cash back on Sephora when they user our partners' âOne Tap Checkoutâ button instead of their other cards.",CardLift,"Mountain View, CA, USA",We help card issuers maximize their share of wallet.,Active,"fintech,payments,consumer-finance",2.0,https://withcardlift.com

1) Given my projectâs SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?
2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?
3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?

Sageâs answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.

No group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs arenât going to cut it. 

We have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called âRAGâ (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.

Sam's ex-girlfriend introduced him to Greg back at CMU in 2017, and while that relationship didn't last, their friendship has. After undergrad, Greg went to Harvard Law School, while Sam worked for three years at Jane Street, building & leading a satellite dev team.

Greg graduated, Sam quit, and we founded Olive with a big idea: use AI to make the law more accessible. We started with AI in corporate law given Greg's background, but quickly realized the space was crowded, and turned our attention to the under-competed $65B personal injury market.

We think there's space for an AI solution that cuts humans out of the loop entirely, and we think we're the right team to do it.

We're focusing on the medical malpractice niche within personal injury, because there's a massive access to justice problem: medical malpractice lawyers decline most cases under $500k since they're too expensive to litigate.

We aim to accelerate and automate chemical process development by equipping wet-lab chemists with the power of data-driven optimization and robotic execution of experiments.


The Problem: 
The discovery of novel pharmaceuticals is one of our most important weapons in fighting disease. However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).


Our Approach: 
In our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening.

Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. 

Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it canât be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.

While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. 

To change that, weâre creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.

Instead of relying on humans to quote, take orders, collect payments, place purchase orders and enter data into ERPs. We build AI Employees that do these manual repetitive tasks for the 700k wholesalers in the US.

Weâre a team of three Computer Science majors, and Fernando launched and grew AT&T in Mexico to $120M ARR. Previously, we all worked together at our last YC-backed startup, building it to over $6M in revenue. It was there that we placed thousands of purchase orders with wholesalers.

We realized that almost every physical product comes from B2B sales in the supply chain. However, it turns out that most of these operations are still done manually through phone and email, involving tasks like quoting, taking orders, collecting payments, entering data into ERPs, and providing support. By automating these tasks with AI agents in a human-like manner, we are creating a massive opportunity to convert $100B of payroll expenses into software spending.

We met while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles, within which we built a $200m specialty finance business line. At Alt, we were faced with the manual workflows from compliance to servicing that are needed to make and manage consumer loans. And as a result, we spent much of our time and hundreds of thousands of dollars creating robust internal tooling to ensure we were doing things the right way.

However, after the pain of hunting through regulatory codes, confusion of form filling, surprise of regulatory deadlines, monotony of PDF data extraction, anxiety of brittle excel spreadsheets, the frustration of buried email threads with advisors, and the missed phone calls with borrowers to chase payments â¦ to name a few â¦ we knew that this experience needed to be improved. 

So, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.

Finsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with:  outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.

Where is this money coming from?

- Retailers: When the price of clothes or furniture you've already bought drops, you're entitled to a refund for the difference
- Airlines: When a flight you've booked gets delayed or canceled, you're entitled to a cash compensation.
- Enterprises: When a class-action lawsuit is filed against a company you engage with, you're entitled to money.
- And many more, that even the government holds some of your unclaimed funds.

Today, the dream of one service that automatically claims the money you deserve when you shop, fly,... and live is (finally) possible.

We started with automating refunds in the shopping industry and have secured $8,000 in refunds to our users, growing 233% MoM. With AI, we've been able to repurpose that same automation to tackle refunds in the flight industry and the class-action lawsuit landscape.

â¢ Profiles with Personality: OrgOrg profiles are as insightful as they are delightful. They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person.
â¢ Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on ""big rock"" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually.
â¢ Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened.
â¢ All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded.
â¢ Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of ""Software Engineer"" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.
â¢ On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly.

They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies. 

However, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals.

ESOPs are a federal retirement plan that enable businesses to give their employees a stake in the company in exchange for significant tax benefits. 

With 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners set to retire in the coming years, there's a growing ""Silver Tsunami"" of businesses across the country in search of new ownership. For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.

By selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of â things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire â imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. 

Thousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth.

In the medium term, we will expand to brakes, oil, batteries, etc. becoming an uptime assembly line that keeps fleets on the road 24/7 at a fraction of the maintenance cost per mile we see today. In a fleet-centric world, cost-per-mile and uptime are all that matter. ROBOTIRE tackles both.

Volumetric is a recognized world leader in building living multicellular tissues, with a focus on replicating discrete functions of the human body for basic mechanistic biology, laboratory testing and screening, and drug development. Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.

Our Technology and Approach
We have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer.

We write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they wonât find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.

Why now?
The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.

Where are we and where are we going?
We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.

We offer online doctorâs visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).

More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

Building a home requires human labor to: measure, cut, lift, drill, paint, and attach. This labor is used for a buildingâs: structure, vapor barriers, windows, insulation, siding, roofing, electrical, plumbing, fixtures, appliances, and cabinetry. The construction industry solves this complex variety of tasks by dividing them among tiny companies of specialized artisans.

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.

Our small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. 

Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.

Our team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants. We are looking for help in better connecting with the biotech/pharmaceutical industry.

India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally ""bringing the gas stations to doorsteps"". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.

Do we have domain expertise in this area? 
Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.

How do you know people need what you're making? 
We have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts. Additionally, we have received over 400 franchisee requests across India where people want to offer mobile refueling service their town validating the demand.",MyPetrolPump,"Bengaluru, KA, India",On demand fuel delivery service in India,Acquired,logistics,42.0,https://mypetrolpump.com/

Sellers can also sell a portion of their equity (starting at just 10%) instead of the entire property or create customized HELOC structures.

**What we're doing**

We aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a ""women's issue"" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.

Mothers simply wear the device on their belly. It tracks babyâs heart rate, movements and generates babyâs health report, so we can consult a physician with just one click.

Modoo connects to an app that allows users to share data via social media sites like WeChat and Weibo, which makes it easy to help family and friends feel more connected.

And thanks to the information it collects, our users reported that, it has helped preventing the loss of 73 babies so far.

First, you have to choose a delivery platform. Then, you scroll through dozens of restaurant and finally, you decide between hundreds of dishes. And even if you choose the right restaurant, you might get the wrong dishes.

On Simmer, we tell you the best reviewed dishes across all delivery apps. You first choose your dish on Simmer, and the delivery companies just take care of logistics. Through this, we are able to charge affiliate revenue for every order.

No one has done this before because determining a cityâs best dishes requires millions of users to leave dish reviews.

Our unique insight is that all the data required already exists online, in blog posts, social media, newspapers. It just needs to be aggregated, analyzed, and indexed. We have built a custom sentiment analyzer to do just that.

Until recently, it was only available in sophisticated clinics and regarded as the most valuable but underutilized assessment in medicine. PNOÄ changed that through the first easy-to-use clinical-grade breath analysis device, proprietary software package, and dedicated metabolic expert support. Through a non-invasive 10 min breath test, PNOÄ analyzes the human breath and prescribes a personalized nutrition, exercise, breathwork, and bio-optimization (i.e., red light therapy, hyperbaric chamber, IV therapy, etc.) program based on oneâs biological limitations. 3,000+ health professionals trust PNOÄ because it personalizes the clientsâ journey through their clinics, builds retention by quantifying progress, and enables the upsell of personalized nutrition and breathwork.

In second-tier cities all transactions are paid with cash, this is why the Uber model doesnÂ´t work (since they have to collect their revenue from commissions). We solved this by creating a subscription model where drivers pay a monthly recurring subscription of 59 to 99 USD depending on their monthly revenue. This also generates a higher LTV with low CAC as well as high engagement and fidelity ratios.

Traction: Since our launch, we have achieved over 2,000,000 processed trips with more than 200,000 users, we bootstrapped until we achieved half a million trips and entered YC.

Market Size: There are over 14,000 second-tier cities in LATAM, with more than 500 million people without any access to ride-sharing or technology platforms at all.

The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience â with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldnât carry around the sensation that theyâre stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isnât to encourage nicotine use among people who havenât started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isnât the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco â first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotineâs pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDAâs public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health â and reduce its costs â through a superior pure nicotine product.","Lucy Goods, Inc","Los Angeles, CA, USA",Lucyâs mission is to reduce tobacco-related harm to zero.

Mighty Buildings' technology has the potential to unlock the needed productivity for large scale construction alongside the opportunity for reduced emissions, leading to a more sustainable product and future. Mighty Buildings was founded by a team of physicists and robotics engineers with extensive experience solving hard R&D problems and building successful engineering firms. They started by inventing a new material that is a 3D printing tech that enabled printing of an entire building, not just walls, in a single cycle. Unlike concrete, Mighty Buildingsâ material is lighter, can be uniquely treated (trimmed and cut) by robotic arms, and features high thermal insulation properties. This allows them to produce prefab housing with up to 80% of operations automated.

Mighty Buildings has a near-zero waste production process, preventing 1,100 - 2,000 kg of CO2 emission per 3D-printed home. They are committed to achieving Net-Zero by 2028 - making the company 22 years ahead of the construction industry.

They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.

The first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.

Our key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.

These fabrics literally change shape in response to a change in temperature: the fabrics become thicker and insulate more as the temperature drops, and they become thinner and insulate less as the temperature rises again. This ""intelligent insulation"" has no wires or sensors, and the fabric's shape-changing behavior comes from a natural materials response. 

Skyscrapeâs fabrics offer expanded thermal comfort across a wider temperature range than conventional clothing. Creating textiles that could change shape with changing temperatures required years of laboratory work by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and weavers, designing and refining machines and processes to make yarns and fabrics that could adapt to the environment.

"Anton Buzdin,Andrew Garazha",S17,,"Healthcare,Diagnostics",0,"Walnut, CA",,"Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patientsâ specific cancers. Thatâs where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They donât always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they canât just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

Oncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

As video streaming continues to become more mainstream and the streams themselves become HD and 4K, traditional CDNs struggle to deliver high quality viewing experiences. Many publishers try to keep up with peak demand by paying for more servers, many of which are almost never used and struggle with video playback. Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. 

Our CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods werenât giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, weâve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, weâre working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

Our ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain.

Extern created the remote Externship, a skill-building work experience that is easier for students to access, and easier for companies to run, than an internship.  Our mission is to help anyone discover and launch their career through professional experiences available anywhere at any time.  Since 2020, weâve created and powered Externships on behalf of companies from Fortune 500s to startups that have enabled tens of thousands of students to build real experience and open doors to incredible opportunity.  


After spending $100K on average for a 4-year degree, graduates find that almost 40% of entry level jobs on Linkedin required 3+ years of work experience. Internships are how many college students get this kind of experience, but the demand for good internships outstrips the supply. Internship programs are difficult to scale, they favor students who already have social capital, and theyâre time-consuming for employers to run.


Externships are short, online, project-based work experiences that employers can offer to hundreds of students using less resource and employee time than it would take to support an intern.  Extern makes the complex process of running an Externship completely turnkey with software and industry experts which in turn makes professional experience more accessible to more students.


By making work experience more accessible, Extern is driving the rapid mobility and upskilling needed for a new economy.  We envision a world where anyone can access work experience as a form of education â no matter their background, experience, or socio-economic status.  Come join our movement to reshape work, education, and credentialing for future generations with the Externship.

While the market is slowly moving to transactional data, Lendsnap is the only company helping lenders get ahead of the competition by delivering original electronic documents and data sets. That means portfolios of our lender customers stay completely liquid in the secondary market. No one else can offer that today.

We increase loan origination team productivity by 25%+ and save applicants several hours on each application as well. Our intuitive and easy-to-use workflow makes it easy and safe for borrowers to turn in and for loan officers to receive the necessary documents for lenders to make a credit decision.

As the only company delivering the right documents and data to originate non-agency loans such as VA, FHA, and subprime, we are able to work with all types of lenders. Furthermore, we are uniquely suited to serve mortgage brokers (12% market share) who have to remain flexible to the credit needs of their diverse borrowers.

We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.

- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.
- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.
- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).

Blacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.

We are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).

And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to Indiaâs only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses.  Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.

Over the last couple of years, Razorpayâs growth has evolved to be an index of Indiaâs digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. 

Razorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway âCurlec by Razorpayâ and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. 

Be it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpayâs several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch Indiaâs Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became Indiaâs first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became Indiaâs largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is Indiaâs leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.

Over the years, Razorpayâs valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valleyâs largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the companyâs valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. 

Razorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - Indiaâs leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - Indiaâs leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 -  The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.

All these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasnât changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.

Mezmo has helped some of the worldâs most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.

It is a fact of life that servers and applications go down causing IT outages. Today most of the IT incident response is manual, tedious and lengthy resulting in more downtime and losses for businesses. At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. 

Enter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.

Big companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone.

Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.

It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.

Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.

Weâre building a software layer on top of the very large and largely low-tech lawn care market. We solve two core problems:
 
For consumers: Lawn Love is a modern, seamless lawn care experience. Gone are the days of physical, in-person estimates, payments left under the doormat, and spotty service. We use a combination of high-resolution satellite imagery, public and private data sets, and human review to generate a personalized quote for your yard â all in under two minutes and without ever setting foot on your property.
 
From there, you are paired with a skilled lawn pro who will show up and complete the work. You can coordinate everything from your smartphone or web browser, and the entire experience is streamlined and delightful.
 
For lawn pros: We start by bringing a pipeline of new customers straight to your door. No more spending hours hanging door hangers or dealing with snake-oil SEO salespeople. Just pick up whatever jobs you want, fill out your schedule, and youâre good to go. We also handle all the customer service, accounting, and collections; freeing you up to spend less time on the back-office work and more time in the field earning money. And thatâs just the start: Our advanced job clustering and routing algorithms help build you much denser routes, allowing you to do up to twice as many jobs per day while slashing your fuel expenses and idle time.

Backpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. 
Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.
Whether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps.

We encourage customers to carry a âbackup cardâ given the wide variety of sales registers in the USA. While Coin 2.0 shares the same form factor as a credit card, it features enhancements such as an electronic display and a single button to allow for simple switching between different cards. With over-the-air updates, Coin 2.0 adapts to evolving payment technology, offering future-ready ubiquity in a small and powerful package. Coin's security features also keep your information safe. Auto-unlock means that only you can use your Coin 2.0 while Last Known Location helps you find your Coin 2.0 in case of loss or theft. Coin 2.0 is designed for use in the USA. To verify identify, a Social Security Number is required.

Lawdingo gives people seeking legal services direct access to independent lawyers who can help them. Such attorneys usually have more flexible hours, lower rates, and greater interest in customer service than to their larger firm counterparts. The problem is that there is so many such lawyers; how is someone supposed to figure out who is right for them, and who has some time to take on their case? Fair question. Coincidentally, we started Lawdingo to answer just that. 

If you're looking for a lawyer, we encourage you to try finding an easier way to get one to work for you. If you are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more effective way to grow your law practice. 

We also encourage you not to take our word for it. Read what Solo Practice University, the ABA Journal, FindLaw, AboveTheLaw, TechCrunch, Lifehacker, and others say about us. This isn't some fly-by-the-night company. This is the future of the legal industry. We hope you'll get in touch.

We connect to smart thermostats, HVAC systems, batteries and EV chargers to automatically lower consumption during peak times. 


Electrification is at the core of the UKâs net zero strategy. However, with the increase of renewable energy as a mix of the electricity supply, comes an intermittent and more volatile balance between supply and demand.  With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. 


Elyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.


Our SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.

We connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%.

- We're faster -- by default, we have a turnaround of 24 hours compared to typically a 3 day turnaround for competitors
- We can reach more payors -- as long as they have a phone line, we can support calling them for benefits. There's quite a few payors in both medical and dental (e.g. Seledent) that have yet to offer a digital retrieval of benefits
- We're reliable and consistent -- there is no person-to-person variation or question skipping when it comes to working with software

Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).


Our AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:

First, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.


Second, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.


Lastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalizationânow you donât have to. We search far and wide to find the âgolden nuggetâ of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.


Because of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.",Fiber AI,"San Francisco, CA, USA",We automate SDR / BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI,Active,"artificial-intelligence,generative-ai,saas,b2b,sales",8.0,https://fiber.ai/

Yuma is automating customer support by providing an AI Support Agent orchestration platform. Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.

We integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.

Top merchants using Yuma can automate up to 60% of their support tickets fully autonomously.

## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?

There are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.

But they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.

Those merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.

## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:

Yuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.

These agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.

We believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.

Currently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.

We are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.

## Fun Fact

Yuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests.

Sage is changing this reality. We take your code and automatically generate a symbol-level knowledge base that self-updates to remain forever fresh. We integrate with source control to pull your code and generate a symbolic graph representation of functions, classes, interfaces, types, etc., automatically determining the relevant context for each symbol, and using LLMs to annotate and propagate documentation via traversals of the symbol graph.

We're fully open source, and provide a unique integrated development & observability experience for those building anything in the AI space. This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.

How? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.

We've got two open source projects:
- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).
- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev

Both Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.

By teaching our bodyâs immune system to recognize and kill the drivers of cancer, we can eliminate the majority of all cancer deaths.

A little more detail to understand our scientific approach: A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesnât recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually â preventing the majority of cancer deaths. 

Our team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Bidenâs Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials).

It aims to solve some of the challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics â quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3â end. This assures not only 3â homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3â end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisternaâs powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",Cisterna Biologics,"San Diego, CA, USA",High quality mRNA for therapeutic application,Active,"synthetic-biology,biotech",2.0,http://www.cisternabx.com

Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.

**The Problem**
In today's business world, old ERP systems just don't keep up.

Their monolithic architecture makes it difficult for developers to tailor to the specific needs, even though that's what the enterprises want for ERP. 

At the same time, legacy ERPs struggle to work well with the variety of cloud-based tools that modern businesses rely on.


Legacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.


Building on these challenges, users of old ERP systems often face:
* Hard-to-Use Interfaces: The screens and menus are old school... confusing, slowing down your work.
* Wrong Set of Features: Too many unnecessary options for you and not enough of what you actually need.
* Lack of Transparency: It's tough to understand what's happening behind the scenes.
* High Cost: The expense of maintaining these systems eats into your budget.

Why Headless?

- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients
- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services

What does it mean to our clients?

- Reduced maintenance cost

(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.

(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.

Co-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry.

That's the same performance improvement you'd get from hopping in a DeLorean to 2035 and coming back with batteries from the future. But it's available today - our tech has been derisked by testing supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Air Force, and the Australian Government. 

Our first product is a simple fixed-wing large cargo drone that is efficient enough to remove the ""green penalty"" currently associated with electric aviation. That's a step change from today's conventional platforms.  

First generation electric aircraft are heavy, expensive, complicated, and limited in terms of range and payload. In the entire history of aviation, that's never been a winning formula. When everyone already has access to the same batteries, materials, and motors, what really makes the difference? The answer is revolutionary aerodynamics, but in a form factor that suits today's operations and manufacturing. 

Beyond our own drone product line, we have partners across Aerospace helping incorporate our tech into their products. In the future, if you want to have the most efficient and cost-effective flying machine of any description, you'll need Seaflight's Flow Control inside.

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.

India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. 

With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.

Gullakâs Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day.

TL;DR: If you sell SaaS or B2C subscriptions, weâre here to help you recover lost revenue due to failed payments and involuntary churn.

âInvoluntaryâ or âPassiveâ churn is a hidden Revenue Killer ð³ for Subscription Businesses

â THE PROBLEM: Recovering Failed Payments is Complex
Involuntary churn refers to the loss of subscribers due to payment failures, not due to them actively canceling. While it is both possible and a worthwhile strategy to attempt to win back a customer during the cancellation process â involuntary churn is not intentional and in most cases, your customers arenât even aware that their payment failed.

ð° Bottom line?
Effective payment optimization does reduce involuntary churn and will increase ARR by as much as 5-10%

FLYCODE SOLUTION ð¡
FlyCode leverages ML and AI to provide Payment Optimization and smart payment retries to maximize subscription revenue and reduce churn. We apply a unique model tailored to each Merchant and their customers to ensure optimal results.

Companies rely on old compensation survey data, which are updated only once every year.

This results in more than 50% of qualified/selected candidates not joining the company due to expectation mismatch.

CompUp is an API-driven compensation benchmarking tool. We integrate with your existing HR/payroll systems, removing the need for manual data entry, and also getting updated in real-time.

CompUp provides the most accurate real-time compensation benchmarking data which helps you make the right offer to the candidate. The platform allows you to make better compensation decisions such as annual increments, candidate offers using internal and external data. 

This has the following advantages :
- All the process of compensation data submission is automatic and needs no manual intervention
- Since the job market is dynamic in nature, the offers made on CompUp's real-time benchmarks would be the most efficient
- The presentation of the offer to the candidate makes it look more appealing and explanatory to the candidate

JumpWire automatically identifies sensitive properties inside large data sets and gives developers full control over which people and applications can access or update records containing sensitive info.

Examples uses include restricting who can read customer PII to members of the customer service team, giving on-call engineers elevated access to production, or splitting user records between regions for GDPR purposes.

JumpWireâs approach to securing data in-place minimizes the risk of data leaks exposing sensitive information or mishandling by other applications and vendors. The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organizationâs existing InfoSec program.

JumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.

JumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customersâ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself.

Today weâre all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.

Yet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.

At Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the webâone app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.

Right now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communicationâless on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesalerâs sales representatives (who sometimes donât even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

Today, all customer software is explicitly or implicitly designed for helping individuals, not teams. This is forcing B2B companies - who sell products to teams, not individuals - to augment their default customer support platform (Zendesk, Intercom, Front, etc) with a second, ""unofficial"", system: Slack's shared channels.

This causes a number of operational and logistical difficulties for both vendors and their customers, resulting in added costs, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities.

With Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions.",Fogbender,"Oakland, CA, USA",Customer support tool purpose-built for companies that sell APIs,Active,"saas,b2b,customer-support",6.0,https://fogbender.com

Almost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).
 
We bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.

This problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.

We are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).

In a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology.

At Protex AI, weâre on a mission to protect the industrial workforce! Weâre building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.

ð¤ The Problem:
Keeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.

Serious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.

â Problem Solved:
Protex AIâs platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.

The platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.

Protex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customerâs facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.

HS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.

Our journey began at Imperial College London, where ground-breaking research gave birth to a technology poised to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics.

The Challenge: Every year, breast cancer affects 2.3 million individuals globally. Post-surgery, 60% of patients are advised to undergo genomic testing, an expensive and time-consuming process monopolized by a single lab in the U.S., costing around $4,000 and taking nearly two months. Consequently, only 5% undergo this vital testing. The rest, unable to access this crucial diagnostic step, often resort to chemotherapyâa treatment that, in one in four cases, is more harmful than the cancer itself.

Our Solution: Digistain addresses this critical gap. Our technology transforms the current diagnostic process by enabling hospitals to analyze patient samples in-house using existing equipment, supplemented with our innovative technology. This approach offers near-instantaneous decision-making data, a stark contrast to the existing month-long waits. Central to our technology is a proprietary algorithm that identifies a unique spectral fingerprint of the tumour in the infrared spectrum, providing a personalized risk score. This score guides oncologists in selecting the most effective, individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary chemotherapy and its harmful side effects.

Impact and Potential: Our solution not only challenges the status quo in technology but also in accessibility. In a landmark government-commissioned study, Digistain demonstrated clinical evidence on par with the market leader, but at a fraction of the cost and time. Already making waves in clinical practice globally, with insurance reimbursement at leading cancer centers, our technology represents a paradigm shift in cancer care.

Recognized by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and Imperial College for our innovative contributions, and supported by entities like the NHS, Y Combinator, and the European Investment Bank, Digistain is more than a companyâitâs a movement towards equitable, effective cancer treatment. With the potential to democratize access to life-saving diagnostics, Digistain is not just envisioning a better future for cancer patients; we are actively creating it.

Pandai is an app that helps students get better grades in school. 

Pandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses.

ð¥ Why do we build this? 

In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. 

There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.

ð¨âð« Who We Are

The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. 

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact weâve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

ð Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. 

We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries.

Unlike Rent the Runway, we donât handle any inventory or deal with cleaning the items. Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldnât have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. 

Advantages to our P2P model

- Entrepreneur-led
    - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of âtop rentersâ
- More variety in inventory
    - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet
- Better margins
    - we donât touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items
    - Unlike Rent the Runway, we donât handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition

From there, Stacksi parses their documents, identifies gaps in their security policies vs. standards, and helps them establish a successful security program.

We help food brands and retailers reduce food wastage and improve product availability by predicting their future inventory needs. 

Food wastage is a global problem that has both financial and environmental costs. An estimated $1.3 Bn tonnes of food is wasted every year and 7 - 15% of that is because of mismanaged inventory. 

We accurately predict future inventory imbalances which lead to out of stock situations or wastage, and also recommends best ways of minimising their impact. Our state of the art demand sensing and pricing engine takes into account several factors like historical sales trends, seasonality, holidays, markdown events and pricing changes to predict future inventory requirements and optimize prices.

Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patientâs unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.

Wyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. 

You can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).

The Wyndly Model 

At Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and weâre committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patientâs initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers â truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.

Once we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.

Our values

**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.

**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.

**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know thatâs how we grow.

**Progress**: We make something better every single day.

*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*

Available as Open Source & Enterprise. By implementing Vue Storefront, you will improve your overall User Experience and lift up your revenues by at least 20%. 

1. Lightning Fast
We are on a mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  
a) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. 
b) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  
c) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. 

Loading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  
a) Walmart found that for every 1-second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  
b) Increase of conversion % at each stage of the Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) 

2. Fast Time To Value
Vue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS, or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those APIs by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. 

Also, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. 

3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS
Headless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. 

It allows business users to edit the content & publish with a no-code approach

4. Fast learning curve for developers  
We use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently the 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!

Most of this treatment is funded by governments, and goes to programs that are frequently predatory, and focus more on profit than people.

Despite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs.

Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. 

In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. 

With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. 

Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. 

The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others.

Healthcare providers contract with numerous payors, all of which have their own systems and processes for authorizing payment.

This results in providers spending $300 Billion a year to get paid, and ultimately collect less money than what they are owed.

CoreCare aggregates administrative patient data from all systems providers work with (EHR, Gov, Payer), standardizes it in our Enterprise Data Warehouse and creates a single net view of administrative patient data for the provider.

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATOÂ®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.

Imagine a beverage company sold $100k worth of goods to Whole Foods & only got paid $60k. The deducted $40k comes in hundreds of long PDFâs with obscure codes that a team has to manually review every single one of to ensure the fees are valid. A % of these fees are always invalid and brands have to go through a lengthy process to get back money owed to them.

The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.

And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.

Fitfu allows you to:

* Track your motion

Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.

* Celebrate progress with friends

Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.

* Discover a new way to stay motivated

The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.

* Stay active wherever, whenever

No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)

"Thushan Amarasiriwardena,Andy Russell",S11,2010.0,"Consumer,Gaming",0,San Francisco,,"We're creating digital toys and tools that empower kids to create, learn & share their ideas through play.

Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).

At Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.",Launchpad Toys,"San Francisco, CA, USA","Creativity at Play.

The business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, ""fake news"", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.

By working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.
