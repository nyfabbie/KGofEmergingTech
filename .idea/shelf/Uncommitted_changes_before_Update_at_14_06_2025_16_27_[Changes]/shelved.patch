However, the development\r\nof LMMs with 3D scene understanding capabilities has been hindered by the lack\r\nof large-scale 3D vision-language datasets and powerful 3D encoders. In this\r\npaper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework called LLaVA-3D.\r\nLeveraging the strong 2D visual understanding priors from LLaVA, our LLaVA-3D\r\nefficiently adapts LLaVA for 3D scene understanding without compromising 2D\r\nunderstanding capabilities. To achieve this, we utilize the 3D position\r\nembeddings to enhance the 2D CLIP Patches with 3D spatial context information\r\nand construct 3D patches. By integrating the 3D position embeddings into 2D\r\nLMMs and employing joint 2D and 3D vision-language instruction tuning, we\r\nestablish a unified architecture for both 2D visual understanding and 3D scene\r\nunderstanding. In contrast to previous 3D LMMs, LLaVA-3D supports decoding\r\naccurate 3D spatial perception outputs, e.g., 3D bounding boxes, directly from\r\nthese 3D patches, without relying on the time-consuming off-the-shelf 3D\r\nsegmentors. Experimental results show that LLaVA-3D converges 3.5x faster than\r\nexisting 3D LMMs when trained on 3D vision-language datasets. Moreover,\r\nLLaVA-3D not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D tasks\r\nbut also maintains comparable 2D visual understanding and vision-language\r\nconversation capabilities with LLaVA.\r\n\",\"['Chenming Zhu', 'Tai Wang', 'Wenwei Zhang', 'Jiangmiao Pang', 'Xihui Liu']\"\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15780v1,3D printing,2023-03-28T07:50:45Z,2023-03-28T07:50:45Z,Instruct 3D-to-3D: Text Instruction Guided 3D-to-3D conversion,\"  We propose a high-quality 3D-to-3D conversion method, Instruct 3D-to-3D.

However, their\r\ninherent limitation in comprehending 3D molecular structures has considerably\r\nconstrained their potential in the biomolecular domain. To bridge this gap, we\r\nfocus on 3D molecule-text interpretation, and propose 3D-MoLM: 3D-Molecular\r\nLanguage Modeling. Specifically, 3D-MoLM enables an LM to interpret and analyze\r\n3D molecules by equipping the LM with a 3D molecular encoder. This integration\r\nis achieved by a 3D molecule-text projector, bridging the 3D molecular\r\nencoder's representation space and the LM's input space. Moreover, to enhance\r\n3D-MoLM's ability of cross-modal molecular understanding and instruction\r\nfollowing, we meticulously curated a 3D molecule-centric instruction tuning\r\ndataset -- 3D-MoIT. Through 3D molecule-text alignment and 3D molecule-centric\r\ninstruction tuning, 3D-MoLM establishes an integration of 3D molecular encoder\r\nand LM. It significantly surpasses existing baselines on downstream tasks,\r\nincluding molecule-text retrieval, molecule captioning, and more challenging\r\nopen-text molecular QA tasks, especially focusing on 3D-dependent properties.\r\nWe release our codes and datasets at https://github.com/lsh0520/3D-MoLM.\r\n\",\"['Sihang Li', 'Zhiyuan Liu', 'Yanchen Luo', 'Xiang Wang', 'Xiangnan He', 'Kenji Kawaguchi', 'Tat-Seng Chua', 'Qi Tian']\"\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24229v1,3D printing,2025-03-31T15:42:10Z,2025-03-31T15:42:10Z,\"Pre-training with 3D Synthetic Data: Learning 3D Point Cloud Instance\r\n  Segmentation from 3D Synthetic Scenes\",\"  In the recent years, the research community has witnessed growing use of 3D\r\npoint cloud data for the high applicability in various real-world applications.\r\nBy means of 3D point cloud, this modality enables to consider the actual size\r\nand spatial understanding. The applied fields include mechanical control of\r\nrobots, vehicles, or other real-world systems. Along this line, we would like\r\nto improve 3D point cloud instance segmentation which has emerged as a\r\nparticularly promising approach for these applications. However, the creation\r\nof 3D point cloud datasets entails enormous costs compared to 2D image\r\ndatasets. To train a model of 3D point cloud instance segmentation, it is\r\nnecessary not only to assign categories but also to provide detailed\r\nannotations for each point in the large-scale 3D space. Meanwhile, the increase\r\nof recent proposals for generative models in 3D domain has spurred proposals\r\nfor using a generative model to create 3D point cloud data. In this work, we\r\npropose a pre-training with 3D synthetic data to train a 3D point cloud\r\ninstance segmentation model based on generative model for 3D scenes represented\r\nby point cloud data. We directly generate 3D point cloud data with Point-E for\r\ninserting a generated data into a 3D scene.

Thus, they typically have insufficient geometric details\r\nand less informative textures, making them less attractive for comprehensive\r\nand subtle research in areas such as high-quality 3D mesh and texture recovery.\r\nThis paper presents 3D Furniture shape with TextURE (3D-FUTURE): a\r\nrichly-annotated and large-scale repository of 3D furniture shapes in the\r\nhousehold scenario.

Due to its superior rendering efficiency, 3D Gaussian splatting-based\r\nmodels have recently excelled in both 3D reconstruction and generation. 3D\r\nGaussian splatting approaches for image to 3D generation are often\r\noptimization-based, requiring many computationally expensive score-distillation\r\nsteps. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an Amortized Generative 3D\r\nGaussian framework (AGG) that instantly produces 3D Gaussians from a single\r\nimage, eliminating the need for per-instance optimization. Utilizing an\r\nintermediate hybrid representation, AGG decomposes the generation of 3D\r\nGaussian locations and other appearance attributes for joint optimization.\r\nMoreover, we propose a cascaded pipeline that first generates a coarse\r\nrepresentation of the 3D data and later upsamples it with a 3D Gaussian\r\nsuper-resolution module.

Improving the photorealism via CNN-based 2D super-resolution\r\ncan break the strict 3D consistency, while keeping the 3D consistency by\r\nlearning high-resolution 3D representations for direct rendering often\r\ncompromises image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel learning strategy,\r\nnamely 3D-to-2D imitation, which enables a 3D-aware GAN to generate\r\nhigh-quality images while maintaining their strict 3D consistency, by letting\r\nthe images synthesized by the generator's 3D rendering branch to mimic those\r\ngenerated by its 2D super-resolution branch.

By analyzing the solid\r\nmechanics of generated 3D shapes, we reveal that the 3D shapes generated by\r\nexisting text-to-3D generation methods are impractical for real-world\r\napplications as the generated 3D shapes do not conform to the laws of physics.\r\nTo this end, we leverage 3D diffusion models to provide 3D shape priors and\r\ndesign a data-driven differentiable physics layer to optimize 3D shape priors\r\nwith solid mechanics.

Although several methods have been proposed,\r\naccurate prediction of 3D hands, which consist of 3D wrist and fingers, still\r\nremains challenging due to two reasons. First, the human kinematic chain has\r\nnot been carefully considered when predicting the 3D wrists. Second, previous\r\nworks utilize body features for the 3D fingers, where the body feature barely\r\ncontains finger information. To resolve the limitations, we present Hand4Whole,\r\nwhich has two strong points over previous works. First, we design Pose2Pose, a\r\nmodule that utilizes joint features for 3D joint rotations. Using Pose2Pose,\r\nHand4Whole utilizes hand MCP joint features to predict 3D wrists as MCP joints\r\nlargely contribute to 3D wrist rotations in the human kinematic chain.

In general, semantic 3D mapping is mainly composed of 3D\r\nreconstruction and semantic segmentation. As these technologies evolve, there\r\nhas been great progress in semantic 3D mapping in recent years. Furthermore,\r\nthe number of robotic applications requiring semantic information in 3D mapping\r\nto perform high-level tasks has increased, and many studies on semantic 3D\r\nmapping have been published. Existing methods use a camera for both 3D\r\nreconstruction and semantic segmentation. However, this is not suitable for\r\nlarge-scale environments and has the disadvantage of high computational\r\ncomplexity. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal sensor-based\r\nsemantic 3D mapping system using a 3D Lidar combined with a camera. In this\r\nstudy, we build a 3D map by estimating odometry based on a global positioning\r\nsystem (GPS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and use the latest 2D\r\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. To build a\r\nsemantic 3D map, we integrate the 3D map with semantic information by using\r\ncoordinate transformation and Bayes' update scheme. In order to improve the\r\nsemantic 3D map, we propose a 3D refinement process to correct wrongly\r\nsegmented voxels and remove traces of moving vehicles in the 3D map. Through\r\nexperiments on challenging sequences, we demonstrate that our method\r\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and intersection over\r\nunion (IoU). Thus, our method can be used for various applications that require\r\nsemantic information in 3D map.\r\n\",\"['Jongmin Jeong', 'Tae Sung Yoon', 'Jin Bae Park']\"\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10020v2,3D printing,2022-09-20T22:04:31Z,2024-02-18T11:59:16Z,Towards 3D VR-Sketch to 3D Shape Retrieval,\"  Growing free online 3D shapes collections dictated research on 3D retrieval.\r\nActive debate has however been had on (i) what the best input modality is to\r\ntrigger retrieval, and (ii) the ultimate usage scenario for such retrieval. In\r\nthis paper, we offer a different perspective towards answering these questions\r\n-- we study the use of 3D sketches as an input modality and advocate a\r\nVR-scenario where retrieval is conducted. Thus, the ultimate vision is that\r\nusers can freely retrieve a 3D model by air-doodling in a VR environment. As a\r\nfirst stab at this new 3D VR-sketch to 3D shape retrieval problem, we make four\r\ncontributions. First, we code a VR utility to collect 3D VR-sketches and\r\nconduct retrieval. Second, we collect the first set of $167$ 3D VR-sketches on\r\ntwo shape categories from ModelNet. Third, we propose a novel approach to\r\ngenerate a synthetic dataset of human-like 3D sketches of different abstract\r\nlevels to train deep networks. At last, we compare the common multi-view and\r\nvolumetric approaches: We show that, in contrast to 3D shape to 3D shape\r\nretrieval, volumetric point-based approaches exhibit superior performance on 3D\r\nsketch to 3D shape retrieval due to the sparse and abstract nature of 3D\r\nVR-sketches.

However, such success is only limited to quite a\r\nfew light augmentations (e.g., random crop, flip). Heavy augmentations are\r\neither unstable or show adverse effects during training, owing to the big gap\r\nbetween the original and augmented images. This paper introduces a novel\r\nnetwork design, noted as Augmentation Pathways (AP), to systematically\r\nstabilize training on a much wider range of augmentation policies. Notably, AP\r\ntames various heavy data augmentations and stably boosts performance without a\r\ncareful selection among augmentation policies. Unlike traditional single\r\npathway, augmented images are processed in different neural paths. The main\r\npathway handles the light augmentations, while other pathways focus on the\r\nheavier augmentations. By interacting with multiple paths in a dependent\r\nmanner, the backbone network robustly learns from shared visual patterns among\r\naugmentations, and suppresses the side effect of heavy augmentations at the\r\nsame time. Furthermore, we extend AP to high-order versions for high-order\r\nscenarios, demonstrating its robustness and flexibility in practical usage.\r\nExperimental results on ImageNet demonstrate the compatibility and\r\neffectiveness on a much wider range of augmentations, while consuming fewer\r\nparameters and lower computational costs at inference time.\r\n\",\"['Yalong Bai', 'Mohan Zhou', 'Wei Zhang', 'Bowen Zhou', 'Tao Mei']\"\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7526v3,Augmented reality,2013-10-28T18:30:24Z,2017-06-05T20:13:39Z,\"KCH representations, augmentations, and $A$-polynomials\",\"  We describe a correspondence between augmentations and certain\r\nrepresentations of the knot group.

Due to unique design concepts and outstanding performance, blockchain\r\nhas become a popular research topic in industry and academia in recent years.\r\nEvery participant is anonymous in a permissionless blockchain represented by\r\ncryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin. In this situation, some special\r\nincentive mechanisms are applied to permissionless blockchain, such as mined\r\nnative cryptocurrency to solve the trust issues of permissionless blockchain.\r\nIn many use cases, permissionless blockchain has bottlenecks in transaction\r\nthroughput performance, which restricts further application in the real world.\r\nA permissioned blockchain can reach a consensus among a group of entities that\r\ndo not establish an entire trust relationship.

However, in the past decades, the massive adoption of blockchain\r\ntechnology has yet to come. Rather than the scalability issue, the blockchain\r\napplication is challenged by its expensive usage cost. However, the high cost\r\nof blockchain usage is deeply connected with the blockchain consensus and\r\nsecurity mechanism. The permissionless blockchain must maintain its high cost\r\nfor security against the 51% Attack. Chain users indirectly cover the cost as\r\ncoins are appointed for blockchain usage fees. This conflict prevents the\r\nmassive adoption of blockchain. Thus, blockchain must be improved to solve\r\nthose problems: 1. The cost of blockchain usage should be low enough. 2. The\r\nblockchain should remain decentralized. 3. The scalability of blockchain must\r\nmeet the demand.\r\n  In my thesis, new approaches are applied to solve the issues above. The key\r\ncontribution is the discovery of the useful PoW. It extends the Nakamoto PoW\r\nwith another usage of file data encoding during the same Nakamoto Consensus\r\ncomputation to prove honest data preservation.

Yet,\r\nimmutability, a hitherto indisputable property according to which blockchain\r\ndata cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's\r\nsecurity. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question\r\nlately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's\r\n``\\textit{Right to be Forgotten (RtbF)}'' provision.

This increases the burden\r\non blockchain nodes, and increases the communication overhead for new nodes\r\njoining the network since they have to copy the entire blockchain. In order to\r\nreduce storage requirements without compromising on system security and\r\nintegrity, coded blockchains, based on error correcting codes with fixed rates\r\nand lengths, have been recently proposed.

In\r\nmaking inference of those measures, external life tables of the general\r\npopulation are utilized to adjust the impact of non-cancer death on overall\r\nsurvival. The validity of this adjustment relies on the assumption that\r\nmortality in the external life table approximates non-cancer mortality of\r\ncancer patients.

We have recently shown that synchronized gene\r\nexpression may be predicted from symmetries in the gene regulatory networks\r\n(GRN) and described by the concept of symmetry fibrations. We showed that\r\nsymmetry fibrations partition the genes into groups called fibers based on the\r\nsymmetries of their 'input trees', the set of paths in the network through\r\nwhich signals can reach a gene. In idealized dynamic gene expression models,\r\nall genes in a fiber are perfectly synchronized, while less idealized models -\r\nwith gene input functions differencing between genes - predict symmetry\r\nbreaking and desynchronization.\r\n  Results: To study the functional role of gene fibers and to test whether some\r\nof the fiber-induced coexpression remains in reality, we analyze gene\r\nfibrations for the gene regulatory networks of E. coli and B. subtilis and\r\nconfront them with expression data. We find approximate gene coexpression\r\npatterns consistent with symmetry fibrations with idealized gene expression\r\ndynamics. This shows that network structure alone provides useful information\r\nabout gene synchronization, and suggest that gene input functions within fibers\r\nmay be further streamlined by evolutionary pressures to realize a coexpression\r\nof genes.\r\n  Conclusions: Thus, gene fibrations provides a sound conceptual tool to\r\ndescribe tunable coexpression induced by network topology and shaped by\r\nmechanistic details of gene expression.\r\n\",\"['Ian Leifer', 'Mishael Sánchez-Pérez', 'Cecilia Ishida', 'Hernán A.

A gene family includes instances of the same gene in\r\ndifferent species (orthologs) and duplicate genes in the same species\r\n(paralogs). Genes are gained and lost during evolution. With advances in\r\nsequencing technology, researchers are able to investigate the important roles\r\nof gene duplications and losses in adaptive evolution. Because of gene complex\r\nevolution, ortholog identification is a basic but difficult task in comparative\r\ngenomics. A key method for the task is to use an explicit model of the\r\nevolutionary history of the genes being studied, called the gene (family) tree.\r\nIt compares the gene tree with the evolutionary history of the species in which\r\nthe genes reside, called the species tree, using the procedure known as tree\r\nreconciliation. Reconciling binary gene and specific trees is simple. However,\r\nboth gene and species trees may be non-binary in practice and thus tree\r\nreconciliation presents challenging problems. Here, non-binary gene and species\r\ntree reconciliation is studied in a binary refinement model.\r\n  Results: The problem of reconciling arbitrary gene and species trees is\r\nproved NP-hard even for the duplication cost. We then present the first\r\nefficient method for reconciling a non-binary gene tree and a non-binary\r\nspecies tree. It attempts to find binary refinements of the given gene and\r\nspecies trees that minimize reconciliation cost.

We propose a new\r\napproach, called gene set bagging, for measuring the stability of ranking\r\nprocedures using predefined gene sets.

This procedure can\r\nbe thought of as bootstrapping gene-set analysis and can be used to determine\r\nwhich are the most reproducible gene sets. Results: Here we apply this approach\r\nto two common genomics applications: gene expression and DNA methylation.

In many\r\ncases, genes blocks are conserved between bacterial species, sometimes as\r\noperons, when genes are co-transcribed. The conservation is rarely absolute:\r\ngene loss, gain, duplication, block splitting, and block fusion are frequently\r\nobserved. An open question in bacterial molecular evolution is that of the\r\nformation and breakup of gene blocks, for which several models have been\r\nproposed. These models, however, are not generally applicable to all types of\r\ngene blocks, and consequently cannot be used to broadly compare and study gene\r\nblock evolution. To address this problem we introduce an event-based method for\r\ntracking gene block evolution in bacteria. Results: We show here that the\r\nevolution of gene blocks in proteobacteria can be described by a small set of\r\nevents. Those include the insertion of genes into, or the splitting of genes\r\nout of a gene block, gene loss, and gene duplication. We show how the\r\nevent-based method of gene block evolution allows us to determine the\r\nevolutionary rate, and to trace the ancestral states of their formation.

In contrast, whole-slide hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained\r\nhistological images are readily accessible and allow for detailed examinations\r\nof tissue structure and composition at the microscopic level. Recent\r\nadvancements have utilized these histological images to predict spatially\r\nresolved gene expression profiles. However, state-of-the-art works treat gene\r\nexpression prediction as a multi-output regression problem, where each gene is\r\nlearned independently with its own weights, failing to capture the shared\r\ndependencies and co-expression patterns between genes. Besides, existing works\r\ncan only predict gene expression values for genes seen during training,\r\nlimiting their ability to generalize to new, unseen genes.\r\n  To address the above limitations, this paper presents GeneQuery, which aims\r\nto solve this gene expression prediction task in a question-answering (QA)\r\nmanner for better generality and flexibility. Specifically, GeneQuery takes\r\ngene-related texts as queries and whole-slide images as contexts and then\r\npredicts the queried gene expression values.

Commonly the state of these systems is not\r\ndirectly observed, but only available through noisy and potentially\r\nhigh-dimensional observations. In these cases, system identification, i.e.,\r\nfinding the measurement mapping and the transition mapping (system dynamics) in\r\nlatent space can be challenging. For linear system dynamics and measurement\r\nmappings efficient solutions for system identification are available. However,\r\nin practical applications, the linearity assumptions does not hold, requiring\r\nnon-linear system identification techniques. If additionally the observations\r\nare high-dimensional (e.g., images), non-linear system identification is\r\ninherently hard. To address the problem of non-linear system identification\r\nfrom high-dimensional observations, we combine recent advances in deep learning\r\nand system identification. In particular, we jointly learn a low-dimensional\r\nembedding of the observation by means of deep auto-encoders and a predictive\r\ntransition model in this low-dimensional space.

We study the performance of the greedy policy, which matches\r\nrequests to the resource that yields the highest reward. Previously, it was\r\nknown that the greedy policy is 1/2 competitive against a clairvoyant benchmark\r\nthat knows the request sequence in advance. In this work, we improve this\r\nresult by introducing a parameter that quantifies the degree of reusability of\r\nthe resources. Specifically, if p represents the smallest probability over the\r\nusage distributions that a matched resource returns in one time step, the\r\ngreedy policy achieves a competitive ratio of $1/(2-p)$. Furthermore, when the\r\nusage distributions are geometric, we establish a stronger competitive ratio of\r\n$(1+p)/2$, which we demonstrate to be tight. Both of these results align with\r\nthe known results in the two extreme scenarios: p = 0 corresponds to\r\nnon-reusable resources, where 1/2 is known to be tight, while p = 1 corresponds\r\nto every resource returning immediately, where greedy is the optimal policy and\r\nhence the competitive ratio is 1. Finally, we show that both results are robust\r\nto approximations of the greedy policy. Our work demonstrates that the\r\nreusability of resources can enhance performance compared to the non-reusable\r\nsetting, and that a simple greedy policy suffices when the degree of\r\nreusability is high.

Specifically, reusability has been traditionally\r\nconsidered an important quality attribute in terms of efficiency of cost and\r\neffort. Increasing the reusability of quantum software will help developers\r\ncreate more complex solutions, by reusing simpler components, with better\r\nquality attributes, as long as the reused components have also these\r\nattributes. This work focuses on the reusability of oracles, a well-known\r\npattern of quantum algorithms that can be used to perform functions used as\r\ninput by other algorithms. In particular, in this work, we present several\r\nguidelines for making reusable quantum oracles. These guidelines include three\r\ndifferent levels for oracle reuse: the ideas inspiring the oracle, the function\r\nwhich creates the oracle, and the oracle itself. To demonstrate these\r\nguidelines, two different implementations of a range of integers oracle have\r\nbeen built by reusing simpler oracles. The quality of these implementations is\r\nevaluated in terms of functionality and quantum circuit depth. Then, we provide\r\nan example of documentation following the proposed guidelines for both\r\nimplementations to foster reuse of the provided oracles. This work aims to be a\r\nfirst point of discussion towards quantum software reusability. Additional work\r\nis needed to establish more specific criteria for quantum software reusability.\r\n\",\"['Javier Sanchez-Rivero', 'Daniel Talaván', 'Jose Garcia-Alonso', 'Antonio Ruiz-Cortés', 'Juan Manuel Murillo']\"\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06541v1,Reusable launch vehicle,2023-10-10T11:40:20Z,2023-10-10T11:40:20Z,\"Realizing Stabilized Landing for Computation-Limited Reusable Rockets: A\r\n  Quantum Reinforcement Learning Approach\",\"  The advent of reusable rockets has heralded a new era in space exploration,\r\nreducing the costs of launching satellites by a significant factor. Traditional\r\nrockets were disposable, but the design of reusable rockets for repeated use\r\nhas revolutionized the financial dynamics of space missions. The most critical\r\nphase of reusable rockets is the landing stage, which involves managing the\r\ntremendous speed and attitude for safe recovery. The complexity of this task\r\npresents new challenges for control systems, specifically in terms of precision\r\nand adaptability. Classical control systems like the\r\nproportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller lack the flexibility to adapt\r\nto dynamic system changes, making them costly and time-consuming to redesign of\r\ncontroller. This paper explores the integration of quantum reinforcement\r\nlearning into the control systems of reusable rockets as a promising\r\nalternative. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, quantum reinforcement\r\nlearning uses quantum bits that can exist in superposition, allowing for more\r\nefficient information encoding and reducing the number of parameters required.\r\nThis leads to increased computational efficiency, reduced memory requirements,\r\nand more stable and predictable performance. Due to the nature of reusable\r\nrockets, which must be light, heavy computers cannot fit into them.

Experiments, both in simulation and on a\r\nreal mobile robot, demonstrate that the proposed robot vitals and robot health\r\ncan be used effectively to estimate robot performance degradation during\r\nruntime.\r\n\",\"['Aniketh Ramesh', 'Rustam Stolkin', 'Manolis Chiou']\"\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02979v1,Robotics,2023-09-06T13:24:45Z,2023-09-06T13:24:45Z,\"Come Closer: The Effects of Robot Personality on Human Proxemics\r\n  Behaviours\",\"  Social Robots in human environments need to be able to reason about their\r\nphysical surroundings while interacting with people.

This exploratory study opens new trends for\r\nscholars and the market to integrate ICT, IoT, and AI into smart education.\r\n\",\"['Afzal Badshah', 'Anwar Ghani', 'Ali Daud', 'Ateeqa Jalal', 'Muhammad Bilal', 'Jon Crowcroft']\"\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4474v1,Smart contracts,2011-09-21T04:33:49Z,2011-09-21T04:33:49Z,Smart Grid Information Security (IS) Functional Requirement,\"  It is important to implement safe smart grid environment to enhance people's\r\nlives and livelihoods. This paper provides information on smart grid IS\r\nfunctional requirement by illustrating some discussion points to the sixteen\r\nidentified requirements. This paper introduces the smart grid potential hazards\r\nthat can be referred as a triggering factor to improve the system and security\r\nof the entire grid. The background of smart information infrastructure and the\r\nneeds for smart grid IS is described with the adoption of hermeneutic circle as\r\nmethodology. Grid information technology and security-s session discusses that\r\ngrid provides the chance of a simple and transparent access to different\r\ninformation sources. In addition, the transformation between traditional versus\r\nsmart grid networking trend and the IS importance on the communication field\r\nreflects the criticality of grid IS functional requirement identification is\r\nintroduces. The smart grid IS functional requirements described in this paper\r\nare general and can be adopted or modified to suit any smart grid system. This\r\npaper has tutorial contents where some related backgrounds were provided,\r\nespecially for networking community, covering the cyber security requirement of\r\nsmart grid information infrastructure.\r\n\",\"['Amy Poh Ai Ling', 'Mukaidono Masao']\"\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07363v1,Smart contracts,2017-06-22T15:19:16Z,2017-06-22T15:19:16Z,Smart Wireless Communication is the Cornerstone of Smart Infrastructures,\"  Emerging smart infrastructures, such as Smart City, Smart Grid, Smart Health,\r\nand Smart Transportation, need smart wireless connectivity. However, the\r\nrequirements of these smart infrastructures cannot be met with today's wireless\r\nnetworks. A new wireless infrastructure is needed to meet unprecedented needs\r\nin terms of agility, reliability, security, scalability, and partnerships.\r\n  We are at the beginning of a revolution in how we live with technology,\r\nresulting from a convergence of machine learning (ML), the Internet-of-Things\r\n(IoT), and robotics. A smart infrastructure monitors and processes a vast\r\namount of data, collected from a dense and wide distribution of heterogeneous\r\nsensors (e.g., the IoT), as well as from web applications like social media. In\r\nreal time, using machine learning, patterns and relationships in the data over\r\nspace, time, and application can be detected and predictions can be made; on\r\nthe basis of these, resources can be managed, decisions can be made, and\r\ndevices can be actuated to optimize metrics, such as cost, health, safety, and\r\nconvenience.\r\n\",\"['Mary Ann Weitnauer', 'Jennifer Rexford', 'Nicholas Laneman', 'Matthieu Bloch', 'Santiago Griljava', 'Catherine Ross', 'Gee-Kung Chang']\"\r\n
