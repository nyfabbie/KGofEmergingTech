lives and livelihoods. This paper provides information on smart grid IS
functional requirement by illustrating some discussion points to the sixteen
identified requirements. This paper introduces the smart grid potential hazards
that can be referred as a triggering factor to improve the system and security
of the entire grid. The background of smart information infrastructure and the
needs for smart grid IS is described with the adoption of hermeneutic circle as
methodology. Grid information technology and security-s session discusses that
grid provides the chance of a simple and transparent access to different
information sources. In addition, the transformation between traditional versus
smart grid networking trend and the IS importance on the communication field
reflects the criticality of grid IS functional requirement identification is
introduces. The smart grid IS functional requirements described in this paper
are general and can be adopted or modified to suit any smart grid system. This
paper has tutorial contents where some related backgrounds were provided,
especially for networking community, covering the cyber security requirement of
smart grid information infrastructure.

and Smart Transportation, need smart wireless connectivity. However, the
requirements of these smart infrastructures cannot be met with today's wireless
networks. A new wireless infrastructure is needed to meet unprecedented needs
in terms of agility, reliability, security, scalability, and partnerships.
  We are at the beginning of a revolution in how we live with technology,
resulting from a convergence of machine learning (ML), the Internet-of-Things
(IoT), and robotics. A smart infrastructure monitors and processes a vast
amount of data, collected from a dense and wide distribution of heterogeneous
sensors (e.g., the IoT), as well as from web applications like social media. In
real time, using machine learning, patterns and relationships in the data over
space, time, and application can be detected and predictions can be made; on
the basis of these, resources can be managed, decisions can be made, and
devices can be actuated to optimize metrics, such as cost, health, safety, and
convenience.

systems. It comprises of different entities and objects ranging from smart
appliances, smart meters, generators, smart storages, and more. One key problem
in modeling smart grid is that while currently there is a considerable focus on
the practical aspects of smart grid, there are very few modeling attempts and
even lesser attempts at formalization. To the best of our knowledge, among
other formal methods, formal specification has previously not been applied in
the domain of smart grid. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by
presenting a novel approach to modeling smart grid components using a formal
specification approach. We use a state-based formal specification language
namely Z (pronounced as `Zed') since we believe Z is particularly suited for
modeling smart grid components.We demonstrate the application of Z on key smart
grid components. The presented formal specification can be considered as first
steps towards modeling of smart grid using a Software Engineering formalism. It
also demonstrates how complex systems, such as the smart grid, can be modeled
elegantly using formal specification.

Internet-of-Things (IoT) and smart devices. In this paper, we propose a smart
gateway platform for data collection and awareness in smart home networks. A
smart gateway will replace the traditional network gateway to connect the home
network and the Internet. A smart home network supports different types of
smart devices, such as in home IoT devices, smart phones, smart electric
appliances, etc. A traditional network gateway is not capable of providing
quality-of-service measurement, user behavioral analytics, or network
optimization. Such tasks are traditionally performed with measurement agents
such as optical splitters or network probes deployed in the core network. Our
proposed platform is a lightweight plug-in for the smart gateway to accomplish
data collection, awareness and reporting. While the smart gateway is able to
adjust the control policy for data collection and awareness locally, a
cloud-based controller is also included for more refined control policy
updates. Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional awareness framework to
achieve accurate data awareness at the smart gateway. The efficiency of data
collection and accuracy of data awareness of the proposed platform is
demonstrated based on the tests using actual data traffic from a large number
of smart home users.

can be deployed and ran on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Due to the
immutability nature of blockchain, no change is possible on a deployed smart
contract or a verified transaction. On the other hand, there are millions of
dollars carried by smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain, and hence, a faulty
smart contract can lead to a huge monetary loss. Therefore, it is important for
smart contract developers to fully test and check the correctness of their code
before deploying it on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose a testing
mechanism for smart contracts in Solidity language, based on mutation testing.
We analyzed a comprehensive list of known bugs in Solidity smart contracts, and
designed 10 classes of mutation operators inspired by the real faults. Our
experimental results show that our proposed mutation operators can regenerate
10 of 15 famous faulty smart contracts, which have resulted in millions of
dollars loss. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed mutation
operators in detecting real faults in Solidity smart contracts. We have also
extended {\em Universal Mutator } tool with our mutation operators, so that it
can automatically generate mutants for smart contracts written in Solidity.

  Comparison Study","  Smart homes are one of the most promising applications of the emerging
Internet of Things (IoT) technology. With the growing number of IoT related
devices such as smart thermostats, smart fridges, smart speaker, smart light
bulbs and smart locks, smart homes promise to make our lives easier and more
comfortable. However, the increased deployment of such smart devices brings an
increase in potential security risks and home privacy breaches. In order to
overcome such risks, Intrusion Detection Systems are presented as pertinent
tools that can provide network-level protection for smart devices deployed in
home environments. These systems monitor the network activities of the smart
home-connected de-vices and focus on alerting suspicious or malicious activity.
They also can deal with detected abnormal activities by hindering the impostors
in accessing the victim devices. However, the employment of such systems in the
context of a smart home can be challenging due to the devices hardware
limitations, which may restrict their ability to counter the existing and
emerging attack vectors. Therefore, this paper proposes an experimental
comparison between the widely used open-source NIDSs namely Snort, Suricata and
Bro IDS to find the most appropriate one for smart homes in term of detection

technologies, and wireless communication activates ubiquitous sensing through
distributed sensors. These sensors are various domains of networks that lead us
to smart systems in healthcare, transportation, environment, and other relevant
branches/networks. Having collaborative interaction among the smart systems
connects end-user devices to each other which enables achieving a new
integrated entity called Smart Cities. The goal of this study is to provide a
comprehensive survey of data analytics in smart cities. In this paper, we aim
to focus on one of the smart cities important branches, namely Smart Mobility,
and its positive ample impact on the smart cities decision-making process.
Intelligent decision-making systems in smart mobility offer many advantages
such as saving energy, relaying city traffic, and more importantly, reducing
air pollution by offering real-time useful information and imperative
knowledge. Making a decision in smart cities in time is challenging due to
various and high dimensional factors and parameters, which are not frequently
collected. In this paper, we first address current challenges in smart cities
and provide an overview of potential solutions to these challenges. Then, we
offer a framework of these solutions, called universal smart cities decision
making, with three main sections of data capturing, data analysis, and decision
making to optimize the smart mobility within smart cities. With this framework,
we elaborate on fundamental concepts of big data, machine learning, and deep
leaning algorithms that have been applied to smart cities and discuss the role
of these algorithms in decision making for smart mobility in smart cities.
